Library and utilities for generating AddMusicK-compatible MML files from
MusicXML.

The tooling has only been tested with exported MusicXML files from MuseScore
3.6.2, but it should work with outputs from other music notation software.
Output files are tested against `AddMusicK`_ 1.0.8.

The software (and especially the libraries) are alpha.  APIs may change at
any time for any/no reason.

Webserver
---------

MusicXML files (compressed or uncompressed) can be converted to MML
files using a simple webapp, contact the maintainer for its address.
Navigate to that site and you should see something similar to

Click ``Choose File`` and select the ``.mxl`` or
``.musicxml`` file to upload, enable the options you'd like, then click
Submit.
If ``Download file`` is enabled, you'll be prompted for a file
download.
If not, the converted MML will be displayed in the browser.

The server runs the latest development version of the software, please
report any bugs or unexpected behavior/output as an issue.

MuseScore Plugin
----------------

A `MuseScore plugin`_ that communicates with the server is also
available.
Download that file and save it into your MuseScore's plugins directory,
then in MuseScore select ``Plugins -> Plugin Manager -> Reload
Plugins``, and enable ``mml``.
Then hit ``OK`` and select ``Plugins -> MML`` to enable the plugin.
You should see something similar to

.. image:: https://github.com/com-posers-pit/smw_music/blob/develop/doc/images/plugin.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Example plugin image

Enter the server address, click ``MML Output File`` to select the file
you'd like to save into, and enable the options you'd like, then click
``Convert``.
You should get a popup confirming a successful conversion, or reporting
an error.

Local Installation
------------------

Use `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable>`_ to install ``smw_music``:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install smw_music

Or install from source using `poetry <https://python-poetry.org/>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install poetry
   git clone https://github.com/com-posers-pit/smw_music
   cd smw_music
   poetry install --no-dev

Usage
-----

After installing the tools, convert a MusicXML file ``song.mxl`` to an
AddMusicK MML file ``song.txt`` by running the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   smw_music_xml_to_amk  song.xml song.txt
